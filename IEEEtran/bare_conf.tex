\section{Introduction}
In 2000, Wood published a paper: The Feasibility of Magnetic Recording at 1 Terabits Per Square Inch~\cite{Wood}. It says, that conventional recording would reach a limit at around 1 Terabit/in^2.

However, current hard disk technology uses perpendicular recording, which already reaching this limit. TODO: find proof.
However, alternative technologies: heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR)~\cite{Rottmeyer} and bit patterned media (BPM)\cite{Terris}
