\section{Conclusion}
Year by year there are lot of approaches, technologies helps to reduce the size of the disk with improved aerial density. Lot of research and implementation is being performed for the above mentioned approaches which provides a way to reduce the size of the disk with aerial density of 10Tb/in$^2$. Within this year or two, this can be live soon with the help of disk manufactures by using these approaches.
