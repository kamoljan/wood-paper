\section{Introduction}
In 2000, Wood publishes a paper: The Feasibility of Magnetic Recording at 1 Terabits Per Square Inch~\cite{Wood2000}. It says, that conventional recording would reach a limit at around 1 Terabit/in$^2$.

However, in 2009, he admits~\cite{Wood2009} the current hard disk drive (HHD) technology is already reaching this limit.

Moreover, the Advanced Storage Technology Consortium (ASTC)~\cite{ASTC} released the 2014 roadmap for HHD area density as shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig_astc}

uses perpendicular recording, which already reaching this limit.
However, alternative technologies: heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR)~\cite{Rottmeyer} and bit patterned media (BPM)~\cite{Terris}
